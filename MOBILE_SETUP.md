# Mobile Setup Guide for Set Solitaire

## Quick Start

This is now a single-player, offline version of Set that can run on your phone!

### Option 1: Run Locally on Your Phone

If you want to test the app on your phone while connected to your computer:

   - Mac: System Preferences > Network
   - Windows: `ipconfig` in command prompt
4. On your phone's browser, go to: `http://YOUR_IP_ADDRESS:3000`

### Option 2: Build and Deploy (Recommended for Offline Use)

For a true offline experience on your phone:

1. Build the production version:
